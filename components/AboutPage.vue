        It is a critical time in history, and right now more than ever, every voice matters. You can either sit back and watch others shape our collective future, or you can take a risk and get your feet wet. Politics needs to move away from the divisive two-party system, and together we can help to make that happen.</p>
        <p>We are here to give you what you’ve been looking for. The political process can, and should be, fun and engaging. The CTC PAC influences lawmakers by mobilizing people to push for legislation that matters. We offer unique ways for you to get involved that are easy to commit to and create meaningful change, to see examples check out our Get Involved page. We encourage people to join as members, which provide you with voting rights on the PAC’s legislative priorities, financial disclosures of how the PAC spends its money, and engagement opportunities.</p>
